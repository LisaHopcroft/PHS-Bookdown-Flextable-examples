# PHS-Bookdown-Flextable-examples

Materials generated for an R code club in November 2019 at PHS.

A simple demonstration of how documents can be generated with Bookdown,
with some examples of Flextable too.

If the Build tab is not available, you will need to close your session and start again (just restarting R won't work).
